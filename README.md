# Magellan wiki
 A map of products and tools in web3
 This is a project I have made to help myself and others navigate through the magical world of web3. This is more about having a high level overview of the wide range of products being created, than a detailed guide to using each of them.
 Note: This only covers the Ethereum ecosystem.

 ### Where to start
 A good place to start off is [[Introduction to web3]]. This is a choose your own adventure book so really, you can start by searching whatever you're looking for.

### How to contribute
This is a wiki so contributions are welcome and encouragedüòÅ. If you see something I've missed, please submit a pull request at the [Magellan wiki Github repo]().
